Hello! This is a quick readMe file in order to run the CalculatorV2 application. The step by step instructions are as follows: 

Step 1: Unzip the Source_Code_Binder_Caden.zip file onto your desktop. Once you do so, the CalculatorV2.java file should be on your desktop 

Step 2: Open the command line on Windows as this is what the software is meant for. I am not familiar with the Linux commands for this, but I hope it is somewhat similar 

Step 3: Once command line is open, and the CalculatorV2.java file is on your desktop, run the following command in the command line: cd Desktop 

Step 4 (optional): To double check that the correct application is able to run, do the following command in the command line: dir 
Once you run this command, the CalculatorV2.java file should be shown 

Step 5: Once you can see the CalculatorV2.java file, run the following command: javac CalculatorV2.java 

Step 6: Finally, if everything is fully functioning, execute this command to open the application: java CalculatorV2 

Additional Notes: 
Hello! I will be honest and say this assignment was really challenging to complete. I did manage to complete this assignment, and everything is functioning as it should. 
However, I will note that performing complex functions are very specific and require things to be inserted in a specific way. I tried my best to configure this software
throughout the time given for the assignment, but I was unable to find an alternative to run the program. Since there is a specific method of inserting more complex operations,
I have provided a video to allow for further instructions. I hope this is okay and provides more context, and I am sorry the program runs this way. I hope I still get points
for at least attempting and getting some of the core functionality down, and if points are removed I understand. I did my best, and this was the final output I could provide.
